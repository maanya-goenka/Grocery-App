# Grocery Application
 This was my first attemp at app development. I used Xcode and Swift for the application.  The task is to complete a grocery list app! A user with this app will be able to input a grocery item and quantity then add it to their grocery list and see their grocery list displayed. The app has the basic functionality described below and shown in Figure 1. Feature #1: There should be an input field for a grocery item and quantity of item. Feature #2: There should be a button to add the (item / quantity) pairing to the grocery list. Feature #3: There should be some display of the current grocery list.  Familiarity with tools and features listed below for project is required: NSLayoutAnchor Class Reference • UITextView Class Reference • UITextField Class Reference • UILabel Class Reference • UIButton Class Reference • The Swift Programming Language (available on the iBooks Store or Google)
